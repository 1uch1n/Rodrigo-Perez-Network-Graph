Visualizing professional relationships of the Chilean actor Rodrigo Perez using graph visualizations.

This project is an experiment in Digital Humanities / Theater studies. Data visualizations are based on an arbitrary sample of plays. 

The repository includes :
- a Python script to turn the original plays database into a Gephi-readeable database (that is, nodes and the links that connect them).
- the first few graph visualization expriments

Graphs were made with Gephi software (https://gephi.org/)
